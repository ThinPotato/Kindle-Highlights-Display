            "\nI could go on. In short, you can\u2019t swing a stick without hitting a major scientific advance that resulted from studying diverse and specialized animals.",
            "\nSharks are the best-known example of an animal with this sense.2 They can detect an electric field of only 0.00000001 volts per centimeter.",
            "\nEimer\u2019s organs do not detect electric fields; rather, they are touch receptors par excellence.",
            "\nthere are 112,000 nerve fibers carrying touch information from the star to the mole\u2019s brain.",
            "\nIn every mammal, the touch, or somatosensory, area of the neocortex is organized as a \u201cmap\u201d of the body. Imagine a miniature human lying across your neocortex with its legs pointed toward the top and its head facing down (this is called the homunculus\u2014for \u201clittle human\u201d).",
            "\nAs you might imagine, our brain recordings from the star-nosed mole showed a \u201cmoleunculus\u201d with a gigantic star and large forelimbs.",
            "\nSorry, we\u2019re unable to display this type of content.",
            "\nWhenever the mole touches something of interest\u2014most especially something it might want to eat\u2014with appendages 1 through 10 on either side of the star, it then suddenly shifts the star to repeatedly touch the target with the 11th pair of appendages.3 These star movements are remarkably similar to eye movements. It takes us about one-twentieth of a second to shift our eyes\u2014the same goes for the mole\u2019s star.",
            "\nA key variable for modeling predator choices is prey profitability, which is simply the amount of energy (calories) in prey, divided by the handling time (time to capture and eat prey).",
            "\nUnderwater olfaction was considered impossible for mammals because you need air to sniff. The mole\u2019s ingenious solution is to use the air they carry with them in their lungs. Much like the star\u2019s backward development, underwater sniffing was inconceivable ahead of time (at least to me).",
            "\nBut in the optic tectum of both mammals and reptiles, the maps are overlaid on top of one another, like layers in a cake. The visual map is on top of the cake (the icing), and the other senses are mapped into the lower layers.",
            "\nHandling time is how long it takes a predator to pursue, capture, and eat prey, and as you now know, moles are world record holders (for mammals), with times as short as 120 milliseconds or just over a tenth of a second.",
            "\nmany fish seemed to lend a hand in their capture by turning toward the strike and sometimes swimming straight into the snake\u2019s mouth. This is the epitome of a finding that raises more questions than it answers. Why would fish do something like this?",
            "\nWith this anatomy in mind, you can imagine what happens when a predator strikes. Sound travels to the fish\u2019s nearest ear, activates the nearest Mauthner cell, which sends a signal to the opposite side of the body, causing the fish to bend away, and then swim away, from the predator",
            "\nThe snake\u2019s J-shaped hunting posture is a set-up. It creates a concave space between the snake\u2019s head and neck. The snake stays rigidly still and camouflaged until a fish wanders into the center of the concave space, at which point one fish ear is facing the snake\u2019s neck and the other ear is facing the snake\u2019s head (and jaws). Then, instead of simply striking at the fish, the snake\u2019s first move is a feint\u2014it twitches its neck. The feint occurs a millisecond or two before the real attack begins, and generates a sound in the water that reaches the fish almost immediately, giving the wrong commanding Mauthner cell a head start in the critical decision of which way to turn. A fraction of a second later, the real attack is launched as the snake strikes out toward the fish with jaws containing needle-sharp teeth. The snake\u2019s strike, the real threat, generates a massive shock wave, but it\u2019s too late. The opposing Mauthner cell\u2014now wielding ultimate authority\u2014was activated first. Subsequently, the wrong inhibitory neurons were activated, ensuring that the muscles for the proper escape direction were shut down. Worse yet, as the snake\u2019s strikes closes in, the C-bend propels the fish into the oncoming jaws.",
            "\nTentacled snakes have been evolving alongside their fish prey for so long, they are born preprogrammed to take advantage of the fish escape system with a body feint and prediction of fish movements. It\u2019s like a baseball player not only learning about pitches but also knowing where the ball will go before the pitcher moves\u2014and better yet, having been born with the ability.",
            "\nWhen I told him I wanted to come back to study the details of worm behavior and how worm grunting worked, he was 100% on board. I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of Carmine and his cabin and how often I have encountered generous people excited about science.",
            "\nInsects have not taken this onslaught lying down. Many insects have evolved ears that have only one function\u2014detecting the ultrasonic echolocation calls of bats.",
            "\nThere are just under 400 species of shrew distributed throughout much of the world. They are, as a rule, carnivorous, which is pretty impressive given their tiny size\u2014some weigh only as much as a penny.",
            "\nMost shrews are born in late spring or early summer and then rapidly grow to adult size. Later, as winter approaches, several species actually shrink their bodies and bones\u2014skull included\u2014along with their internal organs. Their head and brain literally get smaller. And not just a little smaller; the brain may lose 25 percent of its mass.",
            "\nMany of the red-toothed shrews will starve in only a few hours if deprived of food.",
            "\nThe American water shrew has two key, if stealthy, adaptations for swimming. The hairs covering their body have a special microscopic structure that traps a layer of air, keeping them dry and insulated underwater. This gives them a silvery minnow-like sheen when they dive. The insulation is essential because water shrews don\u2019t hibernate. Instead, they dive into ice-cold water searching for prey throughout the winter. The second adaptation is a fringe of thousands of special hairs surrounding their feet and toes. When the shrew swims, the hairs fold out with each power stroke, catching the water like a thousand miniature oars, then folding back down with each return stroke. The hairs provide the functional equivalent of webbing between the toes to aid paddling.",
            "\nTo take this one step further, the lower an animal\u2019s body temperature, the lower the conduction velocity of signals (action potentials) along its nerve fibers, and hence the slower its reactions.",
            "\nStar-nosed moles may be fast eaters, but water shrews have the fastest predatory attack ever documented for a mammal.",
            "\nEarly mammals were also small-bodied, similar in size to shrews, and they had small brains with little neocortex.11 We know this because under the right circumstances, an animal\u2019s brain fossilizes\u2014at least in outline. This happens when minerals get packed into the cranial cavity, taking up the exact shape of the brain, and then harden over time. From these rare and valuable fossils, we know that our Jurassic ancestors had a shrew-sized neocortex.",
            "\nIn the 1970s, the electric eel played a pivotal role in the isolation of the acetylcholine receptor.6 This protein is key to muscle function because it forms a miniature molecular door that allows charged molecules to flow across cell membranes.",
            "\nA heart monitor is a good reminder that muscles generate substantial electric currents, and therefore muscle is the obvious starting point for evolving an electric organ.",
            "\nThe experiments ultimately showed the eel\u2019s high voltage doesn\u2019t activate fish muscles directly; rather, each of the eel\u2019s high-voltage pulses activates the nerves that lead to muscles.9 This leads to an astonishing conclusion: the high-voltage pulses are a form of high-fidelity remote control. The conductive water provides an \u201cantenna\u201d by which the electricity reaches out from the eel and into the body of another animal to hijack its nervous system.",
            "\nI can\u2019t help but imagine analogies from horror movies. Picture yourself hiding in the closet, silent and concealed by heaps of clothing as the hungry monster stalks through the room. You could hear a pin drop, as the monster gives up and finally turns to leave. But . . . the monster pauses at the door and uses its superpower, giving off a doublet. You are forced into a whole-body convulsion, making noise to reveal your location. How unfair.",
            "\nIf you grabbed the eel at the head and tail and lifted it out of the water, then the only remaining path for the electrical current would be through your body. By leaping out of the water, the eel is doing its best to approach this \u201cworst case\u201d position (worst for you anyway).",
            "\nand interesting ideas that weren\u2019t, actually, interesting. Although I didn\u2019t write much about it, I can\u2019t overemphasize how much failure is a natural part of science, as it is in life. That\u2019s something everyone should know, but especially those who have recently started in the field and might get the idea that things should work on the first try.",

Refining techniques from military psychological operations (PSYOPS), Cambridge Analytica propelled Steve Bannon\u2019s alt-right insurgency into its ascendancy. In this new war, the American voter became a target of confusion, manipulation, and deception. Truth was replaced by alternative narratives and virtual realities.",

Presidential debates suddenly shifted from policy positions into bizarre arguments about what was real news and what was fake news. America is now living in the aftermath of the first scaled deployment of a psychological weapon of mass destruction.",

So catalyzing an insurgency within the belligerent\u2019s organization requires first concentrating resources on a few key target groups. This is optimized by good profiling and identifying the types of people who are both susceptible to new ways of thinking and connected enough to inject our counternarrative into their social network.",

In this light, the manipulator attempts to \u201csteal\u201d the concept of self from his target, replacing it with his own. This usually starts with attempting to smother the opponent\u2019s narratives and then dominating the informational environment around the target.",

This means these targets will be more likely to develop an exaggerated suspicion of harassment, persecution, victimhood, or unfair treatment. This is the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d for initiating the subversion of a larger organization. Later, this learning would serve as one of the foundations for Cambridge Analytica\u2019s work catalyzing an alt-right insurgency in America.",
            "\nOne unintended consequence of having large pluralities of citizens connected via mobile phone networks was that everybody could be traced, tracked, profiled, and communicated with.

And that turned the rules of warfare upside down.",

And so Breitbart was founded to be not only a media platform but also a tool for reversing the flow of American culture.",
            "\nFor all the site\u2019s sound and fury, it became pigeonholed as a place for young, straight white guys who couldn\u2019t get laid. Gamergate was one of the first, most public instances of their culture war: When several women tried to bring to light the gross misogyny within the gaming industry, they were hounded, doxed, and sent numerous death threats in a massive campaign against the \u201cprogressives\u201d imposing their \u201cfeminist ideology\u201d onto gaming culture.",

In theory, of course, the same strategy could be used in reverse\u2014to foster extremism\u2014but that was not something I had even considered.",

            "\nThis cognitive bias is called the availability heuristic, and is just one of many biases that affect our thinking. The bias is why, for example, people who see more news reports of violent murders on the news tend to think that society is becoming more violent when in fact global murder rates have been declining overall during the last quarter century.",

In the most general way, Republicans aren\u2019t likely to seek out novelty or to express curiosity about new experiences (with closet cases being the obvious exception). At the same time, they favor structure and order, and they don\u2019t like surprises. Democrats are more open but also often less conscientious. This is in part why political debates often center around behavior and the locus of personal responsibility.",

The audience is reminded that if you are really an \u201cordinary American,\u201d this is how you\u2014i.e., \u201cwe\u201d\u2014think.

You do not fall asleep faster because you are toasty and warm to the core. Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.",
